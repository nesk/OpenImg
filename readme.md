# OpenImg

This is a Chrome extension, it provides context menus to open images, whatever they are background images or not.

## Future features

* The possibility to display background images stored in frames.
* Context menus to only copy (not open) background images urls into clipboard. If possible, I will also try to add buttons to copy background images data.
* Options to choose wich buttons the user wants to see.
