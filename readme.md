# OpenImg

This is a Chrome extension, it provides context menus to open images, whatever they are background images or not.

## Installation

* Download or clone the repository
* Open Chromeâ€™s extensions panel and activate the developer mode
* Load the unpacked extension (navigate to the project directory and open it)
* Restart Chrome

## Future features

The ones that will be added before the first stable release :

* No need to restart Chrome after installation.

The ones for future releases :

* The possibility to display background images stored in frames.
* Context menus to only copy (not open) background images urls into clipboard. If possible, I will also try to add buttons to copy background images data.
* Options to choose wich buttons the user wants to see.
